# STM32F407 Trinity Project

This project was made for my school project to learn some basics about API's and working of Stm32 microcontrolers.

## API's

### SPI API

Remember ! if master wants to read something from the slave,
then it has to produce clock by writing same amount of data to the slave(may be dummy bytes)
